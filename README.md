# Data.gov Catalog

This is a walking skeleton of a searchable catalog of open government datasets. It includes a simple web application, along with the supporting data pipeline. I'm currently working to add "see also" recommendations using topic modeling and approximate nearest neighbor methods. I also plan to add categorization of the available datasets using a multi-class classifier (e.g. a random forest).

Built with:
* Apache Spark
* Elasticsearch
* Luigi
* Play Framework
* AngularJS
* Docker Compose
